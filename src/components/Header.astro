        <p>I am a software engineer and computer science student at the Technical University of Munich.
            <br/><br/>Currently working as a student employee at Siemens and writing my thesis at <a href="https://eclipsesource.com//">Eclipse Source</a> on the topic of "Enhancing Terminal Usability in Modern IDEs Through AI-Assisted Interaction"
            <br/><br/>When I’m away from the keyboard, I enjoy watching movies, getting lost in books and comics, or pushing my limits in the swimming pool.</p>
